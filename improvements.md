# what need to improve
- [ ] implement try and catch when calling api since this api deletes animal Id. I need to deal with that frequent data updates.
- [ ] let a user find a pet without logging in
- [ ] deal with zipcode not existing in external API. Maybe we find city name from zipcode and call external API.
- [ ] reduce the chocies of animals?
- [ ] remove Maybe categories
- [ ] save minimum pet data in database to show a pet on favorite pets page so there will be less external API calls.
